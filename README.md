# Strava Atlas

A free third-party tool which draws all your activities onto a single explorable map.

Hosted publicly at http://strava-atlas.herokuapp.com/, unless that starts causing trouble.

## Run it yourself

To run your own copy of Strava Atlas:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Register a <a href='https://www.strava.com/settings/api'>Strava API Application</a> to get a "Client ID" and "Client Secret". Put them in a file called `.env`, in the base of the repository. This file should look like:

    ```
    STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=12345
    STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
    ```

3. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

4. Run `yarn build` to build the application.

5. Finally, run `yarn start` to start the server. Strava Atlas should be available at http://localhost:5000/.

Deploying a copy of Strava Atlas on a service like Heroku should be relatively straighforward. Tips for specific platforms:

* **Heroku**: Strava Atlas can be deployed directly from the GitHub repository, as long as you set `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` & `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` as Heroku "Config Vars".

## Contributing

Bug reports and suggestions for changes can be posted as <a href="https://github.com/joshuahhh/strava-atlas/issues">GitHub Issues</a>.

If you wish to contribute code, that's fantastic! I suggest you start by describing your intended change in an issue, so we have the chance to talk about it first.

### Technical notes

* I intend for Strava Atlas to support Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. However, I do not intend for Strava Atlas to support older versions of any of these browsers.
